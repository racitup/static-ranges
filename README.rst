static-ranges
=============

WSGI middleware for handling HTTP byte-ranges, i.e.

- Request header: ``Range: bytes=0-1``
- Response header: ``Accept-Ranges: bytes`` or ``none``
- Response status: ``206 Partial Content`` or ``416 Requested range not satisfiable`` with Content-Range of *
- Response header: ``Content-Range: bytes 0-1/2333748``
- Response header: ``Content-Length: 2``

Implemented originally for use with waitress or gunicorn, django, dj-static and static3 because
Safari requires byte-range support when requesting HTML5 videos.

Status and caveats
------------------

I really wouldn't use this for production and hasn't been well-tested. It has been developed as a quick way to get
an app up and running on Heroku for testing with all static and media files served from the same place.

It also only supports single ranges (or overlapping ranges that condense to a single range) but that
probably covers 99.9% of usage.

Install
-------

It is available from pypi like so:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install static-ranges

Usage
-----

Wrap your application in wsgi.py with Ranges as the outermost layer, for example:

.. code:: python

    from static_ranges import Ranges

    application = Ranges(Cling(MediaCling(application)))

Optionally you can disable support which will send the ``Accept-Ranges: none`` header using:

.. code:: python

    application = Ranges(Cling(MediaCling(application)), enable=False)
